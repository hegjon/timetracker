* Define the fileformat
 - Normal working day with 0 in "diff".
 - Normal working day with positive time "diff".
 - Normal working day with negative time "diff".
 - Public holiday with no work should produce a zero "diff" day.
 - Working on a public holiday should produce a positive "diff" no matter how many hours worked. 

* Make a commandline program:
 - Print out per week how many hours that is been spent on working + the diff.
 - Sum the total + the diff

* Make a RPM that works on Fedora 20
 v Just get something to work.
 v Use best practices and depend on packages provided by Fedora for the dependencies.
 - Try to get it to work on CentOS6/RHEL6.

* Make a generic zip package
 - Should work on Mac OSX and Windows (but not limited to those).
 - Contains all the dependencies except the JRE

* Decide on a license.
 - Open Source
 - Short and easy to understand.
 - "permissive" - little restrictions

* Naming components
 - Fileformat
 - Package
 - Command
